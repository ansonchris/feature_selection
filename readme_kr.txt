1. Standard Chartered Bank Korea Limited s a banking and financial services company headquartered in Seoul, South Korea, and a wholly owned subsidiary of Standard Chartered PLC. It was created by the acquisition of the former Korea First Bank by Standard Chartered in 2005. It operates as a full-service commercial bank, serving as the "front-facing" financial institution for the South Korean market.

2. Standard Chartered Bank Korea Limited and Standard Chartered Global Business Services (Guangzhou) Co., Ltd. are sister subsidiaries operating under the same parent company, Standard Chartered PLC, but they fulfill complementary roles within the group's ecosystem. Standard Chartered Bank Korea functions as a full-service commercial bank providing direct financial products to individuals and corporations in South Korea, while GBS Guangzhou acts as an internal global technology and operations hub that provides the "back-office" infrastructure, software development, and data processing necessary to power those banking services. Essentially, the relationship is one of a service provider (Guangzhou) and a service consumer (South Korea), where the Guangzhou center ensures the digital and operational efficiency of the bank’s customer-facing operations in the South Korean market.

3.The purpose of this visit is to conduct high-level technical consultation and strategic alignment for the development of a localized Retail Scorecard Model. As SCB Korea operates under global risk management frameworks, it is essential to have a subject matter expert from our Global Business Services hub to ensure that model aligns with both the Group’s global standards and local Financial Supervisory Service (FSS) requirements. The invitee will facilitate technical workshops and provide guidance on model architecture. This is a consultative role involving no local remuneration; the invitee remains an employee of the Guangzhou entity.
