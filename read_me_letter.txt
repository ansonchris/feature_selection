Work related to model development in Korea typically falls outside the scope of a standard business visa. The STBV team suggested applying for an STBV work permit, which is a type of business work visa that would allow me to conduct model development work locally. However, a potential issue with this route is the entry type. As pointed out, there is a risk that the visa center might only grant a single-trip visa even if I apply for multiple entries.
The alternative is to proceed with a Short-Term Assignment. This is a more formal work visa for Korea, and the labor activities performed under it are protected by the Korean government. This method would first require the Korean entity to create and post a formal position. I would then need to apply for and be hired into that role to legally work there. Details such as who pays the salary and the reporting lines would need to be clarified. Pursuing this option involves coordinating with more stakeholders and requires the finalization of more detailed terms and conditions.
Both of the above methods are applicable to team members of both Indian and Chinese nationality.
